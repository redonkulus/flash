## Technology

Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using the latest web technologies. All the code is inline in the `index.html` file. I could easily use React or many other popular libaries, but I wanted a simple codebase without any dependencies or build processes. If it gets too complicated in the future, I may change this, but it works well for now.

## Background

There are many free, perfectly fine flashcard sites on the web. However, many with obtrusive ads or poor mobile web support. I wanted to create a simple, easily accessible web app for not only my kids, but for anyone else. An easy to use interface, that is mobile friendly and available offline were key requirements.

Feel free to open an issue if you find something wrong or contribute code if you want to add new features.

Hopefully. you find this app useful for your purposes.
